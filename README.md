### React Frontend for Website ###

<details>
<summary>Project Description</summary>
<br>

__Pitch:__ As an artist I want to be able to show off my work. I'm a photographer and I have a lot of amazing foodie pics I'd like to share with potential clients, but I need a site that is more professional than Instagram in order to do so.

__MVP:__ User can visit site and see artists photos laid out in a grid , artist can create, read update photos. No ability to upload one's own photos.

__Stretch Goal:__ Build an image uploader into the site to allow users the ability to upload their own assets. (This will require some work with a package called Drop Zone and a service called cloudinary).
